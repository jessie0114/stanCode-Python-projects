----------------------------
When you finish writing it, MidpointKarel should
leave a beeper on the corner closest to the center of 1st Street
(or either of the two central corners if 1st Street has an even
number of corners).  Karel can put down additional beepers as it
looks for the midpoint, but must pick them up again before it
stops.  The world may be of any size, but you are allowed to
assume that it is at least as tall as it is wide.

    pre-condition: Karel is at the lower left corner of a square world.
    post-condition: Karel stands at the midpoint of street 1 with a beeper.

    The purpose of this program is finding the midpoint of street 1 in any
    square world. In order to reach the goal, there are two procedures.
    First, put two beepers on the two ends of street respectively as two
    boundaries that remind Karel that it should turn around. Later, everytime
    Karel encounters a beeper, then it will turn around, pick it up, move a
    step toward to the midpoint, put it down, and move until it arrives the
    other beeper. By doing the procedures mentioned above repeatedly, Karel
    will find the midpoint when the two beepers meet each other.

    two beepers.
