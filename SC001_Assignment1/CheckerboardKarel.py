When you finish writing it, CheckerboardKarel should draw
a checkerboard using beepers, as described in Assignment 1. 
You should make sure that your program works for all of the

    Karel finished drawing the checkerboard by putting beepers, and three functions
    are used to achieve the goal. Everytime Karel finishes a line, it will return
    to the left end of the line, and prepare to move to another line if the line
    it stands on is not the last one. Notice the program should satisfy any rectangle
